## Apps

`Apps` are standalone apps that are not intended to be used with other projects but with a little hacking they can be used as needed. Most standalone apps are built to be fully automatable via the CLI.

## Libraries

`Libraries` are Doodads that are designed to be primarriraly run as part of another app and are not generally designed to be used on their own originally. They are built as standalone apps for compatibility with other project.

## Archive

The `archive` is for files that are no longer needed, E.G. changelogs (since the releases section is going to hold the list of changes).

Subdirectories are used to assist in organization and are generally created based upon the topic.
