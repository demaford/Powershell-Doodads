## Apps

`Apps` are standalone apps that are not intended to be used with other projects but with a little hacking they can be used as needed. Most standalone apps are built to be fully automated via the CLI.

## Archive

The `Archive` is for scripts and files that are no longer maintained. The scripts and files are kept here historical purposes.

## Examples

The `Examples` directory contains non-functional examples of how various mechanics of PowerShell work. These are used mostly for reference during programming. Examples usually contain an excessive amount of documentation.

## Libraries

The `Libraries`directory contains components that other scripts consume. They are not directly designed to run on their own.s
