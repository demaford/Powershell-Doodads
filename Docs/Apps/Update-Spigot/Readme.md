## Notes:

 - Git Bash is used for compiling the spigot executable. Required by BuildTools.jar
 - Java is used for executing the jar files. Also required by BuildTools.jar. Version 8 is recommended.
 - The internet connection is required by the script so that it can download the latest version of the build tools.

## History
This project was created after SpigotDev announced that the server software would only be allowed to run for 3 days +- 1 day until an update was required.
This project aims to automate the update process so that an admin never goes without the latest version of server software.
